This is the main branch, just working as a test for the demo.
The Should_work branch closely works but it seems to have a problem with the pera wallet connection.

We wanted to use pera wallet identification and then IPFS but as we are newcomers , it is hard to code. We learned much already.
You can launch the front with bun i && bun dev --host in the front folder but you will need depedencies. You can launch the front with the network adress in your browser.
Our back API is python / flask, you can launch it with Python3 app.py

For now we hardcoded the transaction with mnemonic phrase so it is not secured. We would have needed a few days more.
